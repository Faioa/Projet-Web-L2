LTD Signature Series Snakebyte features set-neck construction at 24.75" scale with a mahogany body, a thin U-shaped three-piece mahogany neck, Macassar ebony fingerboard, 22 extra-jumbo frets, a TonePros locking TOM bridge and tailpiece, and James' own EMG JH SET active pickups. The Snakebyte Camo is based on a camouflage pattern created by high-performance hunting gear manufacturer KUIU, a design chosen by Hetfield. The LTD Snakebyte Camo includes a matching special hardshell case. A portion of the proceeds from each Snakebyte Camo goes to Metallicaâ€™s All Within My Hands Foundation, a non-profit, philanthropic organization dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services.
