Depth, precision, power and great looks – this Custom Line dreadnought model has it all. Let’s start off with the tone woods: a solid sitka pruce top combines here with a gorgeous walnut body and a mahogany neck loaded with a pau ferro fretboard, all harmonising together perfectly for a wonderfully balanced sound. Attractive white binding, mother-of-pearl inlays and gold-coloured tuners round off the stylish aesthetics on this special guitar. Outside the living room or studio, the integrated Fishman preamp and tuner turn this guitar into a reliable gigging guitar too. Whether as your first dreadnought or a reliable back-up instrument, the CLD-41SE WN has you covered.
