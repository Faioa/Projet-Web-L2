The Squier Contemporary Telecaster RH brings modern elements and a bold aesthetic to a legendary Fender model to satisfy the most demanding and daring guitarists. At the heart of this guitar are a Rail SQR humbucker pickup in the bridge position (RH = Rail Humbucker) and a Squier SQR Atomic humbucker in the neck position to offer a wide variety of unique tones, and without generating any hiss. The roasted maple neck was chosen for its exceptional tone and stability; in addition, its sculpted heel gives you easy access to the 22nd fret.
