This Type V1.6 six-string guitar will set you apart from everyone else. With its distinctive, stealth looks and feature set, this guitar is a precise, professional instrument suitable for both stage and studio work. The reliable Floyd Rose 1000, made of hardened steel combined with an oversized block, offers increased sustain and resonance while all tremolo springs are mechanically muted. It also features Duncan Solar pickups that provide a full spectrum of tonal options, from organic clean to heavily overdriven, all with fluid sustain and maximum clarity. The Type V1.6 features a set-thru neck/body joint design with 25.5” scale, mahogany body with flame maple veneer top, a fast, thin, comfortable maple neck, an ebony fingerboard with 24 super-jumbo stainless steel frets and Luminlay ‘glow in the dark’ side dots for stage use. Loaded with Solar 18:1 locking tuners, locking nut, 3-way toggle pickup switching with push-pull and full access neck. Available in flame lime burst matte finish, it also includes a Solar Type V deluxe gig bag.
