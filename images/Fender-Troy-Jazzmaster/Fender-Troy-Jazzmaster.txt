You've heard the musical textures and atmospheres of Troy Van Leeuwen in some of the most famous and avant-garde alternative heavy rock bands. From Failure to A Perfect Circle, including Queens of the Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal and Puscifer to name a few, Van Leeuwen's talent as a multi-instrumentalist brings color and power to the most popular rock and the most creative of the last three decades. The Troy Van Leeuwen Jazzmaster, with its personalized elements such as the custom colored finishes, the special switching system and the modified bridge, is as unique as the sound it produces with his guitar.
