The Epiphone L-00 Studio Acoustic/Electric guitar is a direct descendent of Epiphone’s original line of flattops going back to the golden age of acoustic guitars in the 1930s. The smaller "parlor" or "blues box" style acoustic guitar is favored by blues players of all eras for its compressed, woody tonal quality, short scale, and comfortable weight, which makes it ideal for fingerpicking or the bark of a bottleneck slide. Now featuring the Fishman® Sonitone™ soundhole preamp and Fishman® Sonicore™ pickup, the L-00 Studio Acoustic/Electric can now plug-in and be heard on any size stage with first class acoustic/electric sound.
