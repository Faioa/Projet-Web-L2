The EC-256 black benefits from all the technical control of the employees of the LTD factory. With this powerful and versatile guitar, bang the crowd!
A whole new look.
Redesigned in 2017, the LTD EC-256 takes up most of the coolest aspects of the high-end Eclipse models! Its classic shape is perfect for all styles and musical genres and it must be admitted that the addition of multiple bindings on the body and head reinforces this premium side.
A guitar at the top!
The EC-256 features a mahogany body, a comfortable three-part U-shaped handle of the same essence, a rosewood fingerboard with flag inlay and 22 extra-jumbo frets . To sublimate everything, this guitar has two pickups ESP Designed LH-150.
One of the great strengths of LTD is also to have an incredible propensity to revisit and totally update the myths of the guitar: chamfers and cutaway scored for a modern line and humbuckers ESP pickups, Seymour Duncan or EMG for a big sound very current. The EC series has everything for modern guitarists!
