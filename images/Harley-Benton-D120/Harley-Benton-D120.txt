The D-120NT is a purebred dreadnought crafted from classic tone woods that ensure powerful volume and a rich bass range. The back, sides and neck are made of mahogany; traditional X-bracing was used for the spruce top. The modern C-shape neck is slightly narrower, guaranteeing a comfortable playing feel. This elegant instrument is clothed in a sumptuous natural high-gloss finish - and its detailed, versatile sound is a treat for the ears.
